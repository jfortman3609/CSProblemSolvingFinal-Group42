# CSProblemSolvingFinal-Group42
Final project GitHub repository for Group 42.

This Project receives an audio file, converts the file to .wav format, removes any metadata, displays the time value of the .wav file in seconds, the waveform of the .wav file, then computes the highest resonance - display frequency, Low, Mid, and High frequency, and displays a ploy of RT60 for Low, Mid, and High Frequencies, and displays other useful related data.

This Project exists to compute and display data computed from an audio file.

## Basic Usage Instructions
In order to start up the application, window.py must be executed.

From there, an audio file (.wav, .mp3 or .aac) can be uploaded via the "Choose File..." button and ran into the program. The program will generate all of the necessary graphs for you.
- Press "Display Next Frequency" to cycle through low, mid and high frequencies of the file.
- Press "Display All Frequencies" to see all 3 graphs on the same one altogether.
