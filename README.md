# CSProblemSolvingFinal-Group42
Final project GitHub repository for Group 42.

This Project receives an audio file, converts the file to .wav format, removes any metadata, displays the time value of the .wav file in seconds, the waveform of the .wav file, then computes the highest resonance - display frequency, Low, Mid, and High frequency, and displays a ploy of RT60 for Low, Mid, and High Frequencies, and displays other useful related data.
